PA4: Model Loading
========================================

New Features:
---------------------

Loads .obj file specified with command line argument. The .obj and associated .mat files should be placed in the bin directory. If not, full paths for both must be specified (command line for OBJ & inside obj file for MAT).

Extra Credit: Loads materials set in .mat file. Only works if placed in the bin directory or if the entire path is written in .obj file. If material loading fails, default color is white.

Unnecessary functionality from previous projects removed. Loaded model now moves left to right.
