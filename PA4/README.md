PA4: Model Loading
========================================

New Features:
---------------------

Loads .obj file specified with command line argument. Either write entire path or just the file name if placed in PA4/bin/ directory.

Extra Credit: Loads materials set in .mat file. Only works if .mat file is in same directory as .obj file, or if entire path is written in the .mat file. If material loading fails, default color is white.

Unnecessary functionality from previous projects removed. Loaded model now moves left to right.
